            (1) to amend or modify any law of the United States; or
            (2) to limit any authority conferred under any law of the 
        United States,
unless specifically provided for in this title.

SEC. 209. AUTHORIZATION OF SUBSEQUENT TAX AGREEMENTS RELATIVE TO 
              TAIWAN.

    (a) In General.--Subsequent to the enactment of approval 
legislation and implementing legislation pursuant to section 207--
            (1) the term ``tax agreement'' in section 203(a) shall be 
        treated as including any tax agreement relative to Taiwan which 
        supplements or supersedes the Agreement to which such approval 
        legislation and implementing legislation relates, and
            (2) the term ``Agreement'' shall be treated as including 
        such tax agreement.
    (b) Requirements, etc., to Apply Separately.--The provisions of 
this title (including section 204) shall be applied separately with 
respect to each tax agreement referred to in subsection (a).

SEC. 210. UNITED STATES TREATMENT OF DOUBLE TAXATION MATTERS WITH 
              RESPECT TO TAIWAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States addresses issues with respect to 
        double taxation with foreign countries by entering into 
        bilateral income tax conventions (known as tax treaties) with 
        such countries, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate 
        to ratification pursuant to article II of the Constitution.
            (2) The United States has entered into more than sixty such 
        tax treaties, which facilitate economic activity, strengthen 
        bilateral cooperation, and benefit United States workers, 
        businesses, and other United States taxpayers.
            (3) Due to Taiwan's unique status, the United States is 
        unable to enter into an article II tax treaty with Taiwan, 
        necessitating an agreement to address issues with respect to 
        double taxation.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
to--
            (1) provide for additional bilateral tax relief with 
        respect to Taiwan, beyond that provided for in section 894A of 
        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by the United 
        States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act), only after 
        entry into force of an Agreement, as provided for in section 
        205, and only in a manner consistent with such Agreement; and
            (2) continue to provide for bilateral tax relief with 
        sovereign states to address double taxation and other related 
        matters through entering into bilateral income tax conventions, 
        subject to the Senate's advice and consent to ratification 
        pursuant to article II of the Constitution.

                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            January 3, 2025

Mr. Moore of Utah (for himself and Mr. Veasey) introduced the following 
     bill; which was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To authorize the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to establish 
 a commemorative work on the National Mall to honor the extraordinary 
 acts of valor, selfless service, and sacrifice displayed by Medal of 
                           Honor recipients.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Hershel `Woody' Williams National 
Medal of Honor Monument Location Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress in 2021 unanimously passed, and the President 
        signed, Public Law 117-80 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note), which 
        authorized the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to 
        establish on Federal land in the District of Columbia a 
        commemorative work to honor the acts of valor, selfless 
        service, and sacrifice displayed by Medal of Honor recipients.
            (2) The Medal of Honor was established by President Abraham 
        Lincoln and first awarded 160 years ago on March 25, 1863, and 
        is part of Lincoln's lasting and living legacy.
            (3) In 1991, during the administration of President George 
        H.W. Bush, this legacy was extended further when National Medal 
        of Honor Day was established as March 25th of each year.
            (4) The Medal of Honor is awarded to all branches of the 
        United States Armed Forces as our nation's highest recognition 
        for valor in combat.
            (5) The number of living Medal of Honor recipients has been 
        steadily declining, making it even more crucial to honor and 
        recognize their heroic sacrifices and inspire future 
        generations.
            (6) Hershel ``Woody'' Williams, the last World War II Medal 
        of Honor recipient, passed away in 2022 and laid in honor at 
        the United States Capitol.
            (7) The Medal of Honor represents the very best of our 
        Nation--ordinary citizens, who took extraordinary action above 
        and beyond the call of duty and became heroes of our Republic.
            (8) These examples inspire all citizens and ignite within 
        us the very spirit of America.
            (9) The Medal of Honor rises to the level of supreme 
        national and historical importance necessary to warrant 
        representation on the National Mall.
            (10) Locating the National Medal of Honor Monument in close 
        proximity to the Lincoln Memorial within the Reserve would be a 
        respectful extension of his enduring legacy and recognition of 
        what ordinary people can accomplish when working for the 
        greater good.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR MONUMENT LOCATION.

    (a) Site.--Notwithstanding section 8908(c) of title 40, United 
States Code, the commemorative work authorized by section 1(a) of 
Public Law 117-80 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note) shall be located within the 
Reserve (as defined in section 8902(a) of title 40, United States 
Code).
    (b) Applicability of Commemorative Works Act.--Except as provided 
in subsection (a), chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code (commonly 
known as the ``Commemorative Works Act''), shall apply to the 
commemorative work.

                    ``(B) The absence of a substance from a list

                the substance satisfies the definition of the term 
                `fentanyl-related substance' in paragraph (2).''.

if the court determines that the plaintiff is unable to demonstrate 
that the claim of the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits.
    (b) Balancing Short- and Long-term Effects of Covered Agency Action 
in Considering Injunctive Relief.--As part of its weighing the equities 
while considering any request for an injunction that applies to a 
covered agency action, the court reviewing such action shall balance 
the impact to the ecosystem likely affected by such action of--
            (1) the short- and long-term effects of undertaking such 
        action; against
            (2) the short- and long-term effects of not undertaking 
        such action.
    (c) Limitations on Judicial Review.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law

                otherwise limit, delay, stay, vacate, or enjoin such 
                agency action unless the court determines that--
                            (i) such action poses or will pose a risk 
                        of a proximate and substantial environmental

                        available as a matter of law; and
                    (B) if a court determines that subparagraph (A) 
                does not apply to the covered agency action the only 
                remedy the court may order with regard to such agency 
                action is to remand the matter to the agency with 
                instructions to, during the 180-day period beginning on 
                the date of the order, take such additional actions as 
                may be necessary to redress any legal wrong suffered 
                by, or adverse effect on, the plaintiff, except such 
                additional actions may not include the preparation of a 
                new agency document unless the court finds the agency 
                was required and failed to prepare such agency 
                document.

        action to which paragraph (1)(B) applies, the agency may--
                    (A) continue to carry out such agency action to the 
                extent the action does not impact the additional 
                actions required pursuant to such paragraph; and
                    (B) if the agency action relates to an agency 
                document, use any format to correct such document 
                (including a supplemental environmental document, 
                memorandum, or errata sheet).
    (d) Limitations on Claims.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law (except this section), a claim arising under Federal law seeking 
judicial review of a covered agency action shall be barred unless--

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Illegitimate Court Counteraction

            (1) The United States and Israel are not parties to the 
        Rome Statute or members of the International Criminal Court 
        (ICC), and therefore the ICC has no legitimacy or jurisdiction 
        over the United States or Israel.
            (2) On May 20, 2024, the Prosecutor of the International 
        Criminal Court, Karim Khan, announced arrest warrant 
        applications for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 
        Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant and should be condemned in the 
        strongest possible terms.
            (3) On November 21, 2024, the ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber 
        issued warrants for the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant, which 
        should be condemned in the strongest possible terms.
            (4) The bipartisan American Servicemembers' Protection Act 
        was enacted in 2002 to protect United States military 
        personnel, United States officials, and officials and military 
        personnel of certain allied countries against criminal 
        prosecution by an international criminal court to which the 
        United States is not party, stating, ``In addition to exposing 
        members of the Armed Forces of the United States to the risk of 
        international criminal prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a 
        risk that the President and other senior elected and appointed 
        officials of the United States Government may be prosecuted by 
        the International Criminal Court.''.
            (5) The ICC's actions against Israel, including the 
        preliminary examination and investigation of Israel and 
        issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli officials, are 
        illegitimate and baseless and create a damaging precedent that 
        threatens the United States, Israel, and all United States 
        partners who have not consented to the ICC's jurisdiction.
            (6) The United States must oppose any action by the ICC 
        against the United States, Israel, or any other ally of the 
        United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction or is 
        not a state party to the Rome Statute of the ICC.

athletic team.
    ``(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a 
recipient from permitting males to train or practice with an athletic 
program or activity that is designated for women or girls so long as no 
female is deprived of a roster spot on a team or sport, opportunity to 
participate in a practice or competition, scholarship, admission to an 
educational institution, or any other benefit that accompanies 
participating in the athletic program or activity.
    ``(5) The Comptroller General shall carry out a study to determine 
the meaning of the phrase `any other benefit' as used in paragraph (4) 
by looking at benefits to women or girls of participating in single sex

shall document the adverse psychological, developmental, participatory, 
and sociological results to girls of allowing males to compete, be 
members of a sports team, or participants in athletic programs, that 
are designed for girls, including displacement or discouragement from 
sports participation, deprivation of a roster spot on a team or sport, 
loss of the opportunity to participate in a practice or competition, 
loss of a scholarship or scholarship opportunities, loss or 
displacement of admission to an educational institution, deprivation of 
the benefit of an environment free of hostility based on sexual assault 
or harassment, or loss of any other benefit that accompanies 
participating in the athletics program or activity. Further, the 
Comptroller General shall submit to the Committee on Education and 
Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate a report that contains the 
results of such study.''.

119th CONGRESS
  1st Session
                                H. R. 692

 To require the United States Executive Director at the International 
 Monetary Fund to advocate for increased transparency with respect to 
exchange rate policies of the People's Republic of China, and for other 
                               purposes.


_______________________________________________________________________


                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            January 23, 2025

 Mr. Meuser (for himself, Mr. Loudermilk, Ms. Lee of Nevada, Ms. De La 
 Cruz, Mr. Moolenaar, and Mr. Messmer) introduced the following bill; 
       which was referred to the Committee on Financial Services

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To require the United States Executive Director at the International 
 Monetary Fund to advocate for increased transparency with respect to 
exchange rate policies of the People's Republic of China, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``China Exchange Rate Transparency Act 
of 2023''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Under Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the 
        International Monetary Fund (IMF), the People's Republic of 
        China has committed to orderly exchange rate arrangements, the 
        avoidance of exchange rate manipulation, and cooperation with 
        the IMF to ensure ``firm surveillance'' of the exchange rate 
        policies of the People's Republic of China. Pursuant to Article 
        VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF, the IMF may 
        require the People's Republic of China to furnish data on gold 
        and foreign exchange holdings, including assets held by non-
        official agencies of the People's Republic of China.
            (2) In its November 2022 report, entitled ``Macroeconomic 
        and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners of the 
        United States'', the Department of the Treasury concluded, 
        ``China provides very limited transparency regarding key 
        features of its exchange rate mechanism, including the policy 
        objectives of its exchange rate management regime and its 
        activities in the offshore RMB market.''. The Department 
        continued: ``China's lack of transparency and use of a wide 
        array of tools complicate Treasury's ability to assess the 
        degree to which official actions are designed to impact the 
        exchange rate.''.
            (3) In that report, the Department further noted that 
        ``China's failure to publish foreign exchange intervention and 
        broader lack of transparency around key features of its 
        exchange rate mechanism make it an outlier among major 
        economies and warrants Treasury's close monitoring.''.

SEC. 3. ADVOCACY FOR INCREASED EXCHANGE RATE TRANSPARENCY FROM CHINA.

    The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States 
Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (in this Act 
referred to as the ``IMF'') to use the voice and vote of the United 
States to advocate for--
            (1) increased transparency from the People's Republic of 
        China, and enhanced multilateral and bilateral surveillance by 
        the IMF, with respect to the exchange rate arrangements of the 
        People's Republic of China, including any indirect foreign 
        exchange market intervention through Chinese financial 
        institutions or state-owned enterprises;
            (2) in connection with consultations with the People's 
        Republic of China under Article IV of the Articles of Agreement 
        of the IMF, the inclusion of any significant divergences by the 
        People's Republic of China from the exchange rate policies of 
        other issuers of currencies used in determining the value of 
        Special Drawing Rights; and
            (3) during governance reviews of the IMF, stronger 
        consideration by IMF members and management of the performance 
        of China as a responsible stakeholder in the international 
        monetary system when evaluating quota and voting shares at the 
        IMF.

SEC. 4. SUNSET.

    This Act shall have no force or effect on or after the date that is 
30 days after the earlier of--
            (1) the date that the United States Governor of the IMF 
        reports to the Congress that the People's Republic of China--
                    (A) is in substantial compliance with obligations 
                of the People's Republic of China under the Articles of 
                Agreement of the IMF regarding orderly exchange rate 
                arrangements; and
                    (B) has undertaken exchange rate policies and 
                practices consistent with those of other issuers of 
                currencies used in determining the value of Special 
                Drawing Rights; and
            (2) the date that is 7 years after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act.
